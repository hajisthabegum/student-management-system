This system is a simple student management web application built using PHP and MySQL. It includes three main parts:

Login System:
Users log in with their email and password. The system checks their credentials using hashed passwords and manages sessions to keep them secure.

Database Connection:
A separate file securely connects the app to a MySQL database named students_records using PDO. It handles errors and ensures data is safely accessed.

Admin Panel:
After logging in, admins can add, view, update, or delete student records. The interface is styled with Bootstrap and supports full CRUD functionality.

Itâ€™s a basic and secure platform to manage student details.
